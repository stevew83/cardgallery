project description:
I intend to use a website to store and display some cards. It will be deployed on streamlit.io
Cards are grouped in to 9 card groups and displayed in 3x3 grids.
For example, my first group is vintage hockey. My second is late 19th early 20th
century Non Sports. But card categories can have any number of cards. If a category has 50
cards, there are 6 pages: 5 full ones (45), and a 6th with 5 cards for a total of 50.

I may try to create a dropdown that would allow you to move between different csv files.

A lot of work left to do such as removing horizontal bars above and below cards. 
App doesn't work well on mobile yet. Charts could display more useful information
